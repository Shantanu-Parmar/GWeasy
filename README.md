# ECLIPTA FORGE - GW DatFetch

## GW DatFetch: Multiplatform GUI Software for Gravitational Wave Data Analysis

### **Overview**
**ECLIPTA FORGE** is a user-friendly, GUI-based software designed to streamline the process of **fetching, analyzing, and visualizing gravitational wave (GW) data**. This software aims to reduce the complexity of installing and running GW analysis tools by integrating all necessary software requirements into a single, easy-to-use platform.

### **Project Details**
- **Project Timeline:** February - April 2025
- **Lead Developer:** Shantanusinh Parmar
- **Supervisor:** Prof. Chandrasinh Parmar
- **Target Platforms:** Windows (initially), Linux (future compatibility planned)
- **Primary Software Components:**
  - LIGO data fetching
  - OMICRON analysis pipeline
  - User-friendly GUI
  - Visualization tools
  - One-click installation and setup

## **1. Introduction**
The **Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)** operates **four detectors** and collects data across **six runs**, with over **300 channels**, multiple sampling rates, and countless time segments. This raw time-series GW data is then analyzed using various pipelines such as:
- **OMICRON**
- **Coherent WaveBurst (cWB)**
- **Matched filtering**
- **Fourier transforms**

Currently, setting up the software environment for such analyses is a major challenge. The goal of this project is to simplify this process by creating a GUI-based tool that can handle everythingâ€”from **installation to execution**â€”without requiring extensive technical knowledge.

## **2. Background & Motivation**
While working with GW data, I encountered numerous challenges, spending over **10 weeks** resolving library conflicts, configuring environment files, and understanding poorly documented installation processes. Through collaboration with scientists, developers, and LIGO repository maintainers, I finally managed to get the **correct workflow** established.

This experience highlighted the need for a **user-friendly, platform-independent tool** that can:
- Automate the **installation** of required dependencies.
- Manage **multiple pipelines** with ease.
- Provide an **intuitive GUI** for data selection, analysis, and visualization.
- Offer a **one-click** install and execution process.

Many astrophysicists spend more time setting up the software than analyzing the data. **GW DatFetch** aims to **eliminate this technical barrier**, allowing researchers to focus on their primary goal: **gravitational wave science**.

## **4. Installation & Dependencies**
### **Conda Environment Setup**
GW DatFetch relies on **Conda** for package and environment management. To install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

#### **Step 1: Set Up the Main Environment (Windows/Linux)**
```sh
conda create --name GWeasy python=3.8
conda activate GWeasy
```
#### **Step 2: Install Required Packages**
```sh
conda install conda-forge::omicron
conda install conda-forge::gwpy
conda install conda-forge::gwosc
conda install conda-forge::nds2-client
conda install conda-forge::python-nds2-client
conda install anaconda::pandas
conda install conda-forge::python-framel
pip install PyQt5 PIL cefPython3 sys threading subprocess os tkinter
```

#### **Step 3: Set Up the OMICRON Environment (WSL/Linux)**
```sh
conda create --name omicron python=3.8
conda activate omicron
```

### **Building the Executable (Windows Only)**
To generate a standalone `.exe` file, use **PyInstaller**:
```sh
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --hidden-import PIL --hidden-import PIL.Image --hidden-import PIL.ImageTk GWeasy.py
```
The executable will be found in the `dist/` directory.
